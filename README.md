# Containerization Project - VProfile Application Stack

## Project Overview

In this project, we'll explore the process of containerize an existing application "VProfile application stack". The goal is to leverage container technology, specifically Docker, to enhance deployment processes, save costs, and make the application stack more portable and scalable.

### Scenario

Imagine managing a multi-tier application stack or numerous services in an application stack running on various environments such as VMs (VMware or cloud environments like AWS EC2 instances). With the Agile trend emphasizing continuous deployment, the challenges arise from resource wastage, lack of synchronization across environments, and the complexity of managing microservices on virtual machines.

### Problems with Traditional Deployment

1. **Cost Implications:** High operational expenditure and resource wastage.
2. **Human Errors:** Deployment errors due to different environments and versions.
3. **Microservice Challenges:** Inefficient resource utilization in a microservice architecture.
4. **Lack of Portability:** Applications may not work consistently across different environments.

### Solution - Containerization with Docker

Containers offer a solution to the mentioned problems by providing:

- **Resource Efficiency:** Containers use fewer resources as they eliminate the need for a full operating system.
- **Consistent Deployments:** Images packaged with dependencies ensure consistent deployment across all environments.
- **Cost Savings:** Reduced resource wastage leads to cost savings.
- **Portability:** Applications become more portable and work seamlessly across different environments.

## Tools Used

In this project, we'll be using the following tools:

- **Docker:** Container runtime environment for building images.
- **Docker Compose:** Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- **Docker Hub:** Container registry for hosting Docker images.

## Project Workflow

Here are the key steps involved in containerizing the VProfile application stack:\

1. **Dockerization Steps:**
   - Identify and find the right base images for services (nginx, TomCat, MySQL, MemCached, RabbitMQ) from Docker Hub.
   - Write Dockerfiles for services that require customization (e.g., TomCat for deploying artifacts).
   - Build customized images using the Docker Build command.
   - Use Docker Compose to launch multi-container environments for testing.

2. **Testing and Verification:**
   - Verify that the containers work seamlessly together.
   - Ensure consistent behavior across different environments.

3. **Pushing to Docker Hub:**
   - Push customized Docker images to Docker Hub under your account.

## Architecture

The architectural design involves fetching source code from a Git repository and implementing the entire Docker workflow. This includes writing Dockerfiles, building images, and testing containers using Docker Compose.
